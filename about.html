    <div class="desc">The player turns over two cards, one at a time. The cards are kept in position.
      If the cards match, the cards stay open and the player turns over two more cards.
      If the cards do not match, the cards turn face-down.
      Play continues until all the cards have been matched.
      You should watch carefully and remember where cards are located. Then, when you turn over your first card, you
      may remember where to find a matching card.
