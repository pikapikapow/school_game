    <div class="desc">The player turns over two cards, one at a time. The cards are kept in position.
      If the cards match, the player takes the cards and turns over two more cards.
      If the cards do not match, the player turns the cards face-down. Play passes to the next player to the left.
      Play continues until all the cards have been picked up.
      You should watch carefully and remember where cards are located. Then, when you turn over your first card, you
      may remember where to find a matching card.</div>
